Null Hypothesis: There is no gender paygap for full professors
Alternate Hypothesis: There is a gender paygap for full professors

```{r}
set.seed(1492)
FullSimulation = Faculty %>%
  filter(Title2 == "Full") %>%
  specify(Salary ~ Gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Male","Female"))

Faculty %>% 
  filter(Title2 == "Full") %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(
   mean(Salary) 
  )
FullSimulation %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = 122598.3-107705.9, direction = "two.sided")


```

With a p-value of 0.418. We fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence that there is a difference in pay between Male and Female Full Professors at this institution.
